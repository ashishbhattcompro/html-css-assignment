Array.prototype.forEach is not designed for asynchronous code. 
(It was not suitable for promises, and it is not suitable for async-await.)

For example, the following forEach loop might not do what it appears to do:
const players = await this.getWinners();

// BAD
await players.forEach(async (player) => {
  await givePrizeToPlayer(player);
});

await sendEmailToAdmin('All prizes awarded');
What's wrong with it?
    •    The promises returned by the iterator function are not handled. 
            So if one of them throws an error, the error won't be caught. 
            (In Node 10, if no unhandledrejectionlistener has been registered, 
            that will cause the process to crash!)
    •    Because forEach does not wait for each promise to resolve, all the prizes are awarded 
            in parallel, not serial (one by one).
    •    So the loop actually finishes iterating before any of the prizes 
            have finished been awarded (but after they have all started being awarded).
    •    As a result, sendEmailToAdmin()sends the email before any of the prizes 
            have finished being awarded. Maybe none of them will end up being awarded 
            (they might all throw an error)!

0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3 why?
